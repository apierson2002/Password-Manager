# Software Development Library

The SDL contains all of the project's documentation including the following:

* Team meeting minutes
* Team work logs
* Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
* Software Development Management Plan (SDMP)
* Code Style Guide
* Secure Coding Guide
* Configuration Management Plan (CM Plan)
* Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP)
* Software Design Document (SDD)
* Change requests
* Requirements Traceability Verification Matrix (RTVM)
* Test Plan
* Test results for every formal test (peer review tests, unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests)
* Software User Manual

As these documents are created, link them with markdown. For entries in the above list that are multiple documents, create an appropriately named folder and link it. Every created folder should contain a `README.md` that links all the documents inside the folder.

For all plans include the LaTeX sources, images, and the baselined PDFs.

Change request documents should contain links (issue number) to the change request issue.
